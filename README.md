# Docker ClamAV

We have paired Docker with ClamAV®. This delivers an easy to deploy open source (GPL) anti-virus engine used that can be used in variety of situations including email scanning, web scanning, and end point security.

The service runs `clamd` within a lightweight Alpine Linux Docker image. This provides a portable, flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner, builds with the current virus databases and runs `freshclam` in the background.

# Usage
First, you can build the image or pull it:

### Get the image
```bash
docker build -t easysoft/clamav .
```
The easier thing to do would be to pull it:
```bash
docker pull easysoft/clamav
```
### Starting your container
Next, to run the image you can use:
```bash
docker run  --name "clamav" -d -p 3310:3310 easysoft/clamav
```
 or via a simpler (recommended!) approach is to use the included Docker compose file:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The benefit of compose is the use of a Docker volume to hold the clam database files which allows them to persist across builds and updates.

```bash
volumes:
  clamd_data:
    driver: local
```

### Update unofficial signatures

When the container is running:
```bash
docker exec -it "clamav" /usr/local/sbin/clamav-unofficial-sigs.sh
```
```bash
docker exec -it "clamav" /usr/bin/clamdscan --reload
```

# Configuration

There are a few different configuration files. The principle is for `clamd` as it governs the core behavior of the service.

## Clamd

`clamd` is listening on exposed port 3310. We use a default configuration:

```bash
LogSyslog yes
PidFile /var/run/clamd.pid
LocalSocket /var/run/clamd.sock
FixStaleSocket true
LocalSocketGroup clamav
LocalSocketMode 666
TemporaryDirectory /tmp
DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav
TCPSocket 3310
TCPAddr {{PUBLICIPV4}}
MaxConnectionQueueLength 200
MaxThreads 10
ReadTimeout 400
Foreground true
StreamMaxLength 100M
HeuristicScanPrecedence yes
StructuredDataDetection no
#StructuredSSNFormatNormal yes
ScanPE yes
ScanELF yes
DetectBrokenExecutables yes
ScanOLE2 yes
ScanPDF yes
ScanSWF yes
ScanMail yes
PhishingSignatures yes
PhishingScanURLs yes
ScanArchive yes
ArchiveBlockEncrypted no
MaxScanSize 1000M
MaxFileSize 1000M
Bytecode yes
BytecodeSecurity TrustSigned
BytecodeTimeout 240000
```
## Freshclam
freshclam is a virus database update tool for ClamAV. It is run as a background process via `cron`:

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
59 3 * * * /usr/bin/env bash -c 'freshclam --quiet' 2>&1
```

The default configuration for `freshclam`:
```bash
LogSyslog yes
DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net
TestDatabases yes
ReceiveTimeout 60
ConnectTimeout 60
```
Freshclam may be triggered by `/etc/monitrc` as well. See "Monitoring" below.

# Virus Tests
A virus test check will run periodically via `/bin/bash -c '/tests/test_virus.sh'`. This is run to validate that clamd is able to scan for known virus signatures. If this test fails, then the container will restart.

The following are the test virus signature files in `/tests/virus/`:

```bash
clam-v2.rar
lam-v3.rar
clam.cab
clam.exe
clam.exe.bz2
clam.zip
eicar.com
multi.zip
program.doc
test.rar
test.txt
Программа.doc
```

# Monitoring
Services in the container are monitored via `monit`. Monit is orchestrating the automated monitoring for various health and upkeep operations. For example, here are a few operations it cares for:

```bash
check process clamd-process with pidfile /run/clamav/clamd.pid
    start program = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/clam start'" with timeout 60 seconds
    stop program = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/clam stop'"
    if cpu > 90% for 8 cycles then restart
    if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout

check program clamd-scan-check with path "/bin/bash -c '/tests/test_virus.sh'"
    every 10 cycles
    start program = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/clam start'" with timeout 60 seconds
    stop program = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/clam stop'"
    if status != 0 for 2 cycles then stop

check host clamd-server-port with address {{PUBLICIPV4}}
    start program = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/clam start'" with timeout 60 seconds
    stop program = "/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/clam stop'"
    if failed port 3310 for 3 cycles then restart

check file clamd-db-main with path /var/lib/clamav/main.cvd
    if timestamp > 80 hour then exec "/usr/bin/freshclam --quiet"

check file clamd-db-daily with path /var/lib/clamav/daily.cvd
    if timestamp > 80 hour then exec "/usr/bin/freshclam --quiet"

check file clamd-db-bytecode with path /var/lib/clamav/bytecode.cvd
    if timestamp > 80 hour then exec "/usr/bin/freshclam --quiet"
```

### Verify Status
To verify that everything is running as expected in the container you can use Monit status. The command will look something like this: `docker exec -it clamd monit status`. This will generate the Monit status view:

```bash
Monit 5.25.1 uptime: 0m
